# Learning Go

Solutions to exercises from Boot.dev, demonstrating my progress and learning in backend development using Go. This repository covers various Go programming concepts, including:

- **Structs and Methods**: Implementing and working with structs and associated methods.
- **Interfaces**: Understanding and implementing interfaces in Go.
- **Embedded Structs**: Utilizing embedded structs for composition.
- **Type Assertions and Type Switches**: Handling different types dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: Creating and working with error interfaces.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Combining multiple interfaces in Go.
