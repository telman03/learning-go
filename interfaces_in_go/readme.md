### Assignment

The *birthdayMessage* and *sendingReport* structs already have implementations of the *getMessage* method. The *getMessage* method returns a string, and any type that implements the method can be considered a message (meaning it implements the message interface).

Add the *getMessage()* method signature as a requirement on the message interface.
Complete the sendMessage function. It should return:
The content of the message.
The cost of the message, which is the length of the message multiplied by 3.
Notice that your code doesn't care at all about whether a specific message is a *birthdayMessage* or a *sendingReport!*
